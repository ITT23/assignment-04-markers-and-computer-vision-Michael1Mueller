## AR Game

Hold Aruco-Sheet vertical. 

The camera image should be warped if all markers are in your camera view. Place your finger to see it on the left side of the game view. Try to catch as many butterflies as you can. If you miss three butterflies you loose. You can restart by pressing "r"-key or quit by pressing "q"-key. 

Note: You should't play in a dark setting, in order to detect your finger correctly.
